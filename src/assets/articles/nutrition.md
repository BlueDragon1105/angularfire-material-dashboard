## What is nutrition?
> "All disease begins in the gut." - Hippocrates

**Nutrition** is the science that focuses on the inner processes and transformation acted upon the food and its organic components, called **nutrients**, from our diet. The processes are food **intake**, **absorption**, **assimilation**, **biosynthesis**, **catabolism**, and **excretion**.

In a less formal way, nutrition is the process of nutrient uptake within our body. This is why good nutrition refers to a diet that is high in nutritional value or **nutrient density**. The well known cliche ***we are what we eat*** is true: every absorbed and not eliminated food compound becomes part of our living body.

We rarely think our food in terms of its composition. We think of food only in terms of our 3 
senses: sight, smell, and taste. This worked for us a few centuries ago, but now, we live in an era where the more pleasant a food product is to our sense, the more damaging it is to our body.

Food has become less and less nutrients dense and higher and higher in **energy density** (read below) and pollutants.This increases the prevalence of **malnutrition** like never before, not to mention the diversity of chronic diseases, like obesity, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular disease, to name a few.

The bright side is everything can be reversed through discipline and dedication. Only by willing to  develop healthy habits we can face the dark (sick) times that have come upon us. Modern times require modern solutions.

## Nutrient classification
Food is composed of chemical compounds, the majority of which are extremely useful to our body. As stated earlier, proper nutrition involves a nutrient dense diet. This may be to abstract or 
may trigger confusion. You see, not all nutrients are required by our body to thrive. On the 
contrary, some nutrients are detrimental after specific threshold.

From this point of view, there are two major nutrients: essential and non-essential.

**Essential nutrients** are nutrients which the body cannot manufacture on its own, hence the 
name essential. These are
 the
 nutrients that require our primary focus when it comes to our food choices.
 
 There are approximately 50 essential nutrients:
- **Oxygen**;
- **Water**;
- Mineral elements (Electrolytes):
    - **Calcium**;
    - **Phosphorus**;
    - **Potassium**;
    - **Sulfur**;
    - **Sodium**;
    - **Chlorine**;
    - **Magnesium**.
- Trace mineral elements:
    - **Iron**;
    - **Iodine**;
    - **Copper**;
    - **Zinc**;
    - **Manganese**;
    - **Cobalt**;
    - **Chromium**;
    - **Selenium**;
    - **Molybdenum**;
    - **Fluorine**;
    - **Tin**;
    - **Silicon**;
    - **Vanadium**.
- Essential Amino Acids:
    - **Histidine**;
    - **Isoleucine**;
    - **Leucine**;
    - **Lysine**;
    - **Methionine**;
    - **Phenylalanine**;
    - **Threonine**;
    - **Tryptophan**;
    - **Valine**.
- Essential Fatty Acids:
    - **Linoleic acid (LA)**;
    - **Alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA)**;
    - **Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)**;
    - **Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)**.
- Water-soluble vitamins:
    - **B1 (Thiamine)**;
    - **B2 (Riboflavin)**;
    - **B3 (Niacin)**;
    - **B5 (Pantothenic acid)**;
    - **B6 (Pyridoxine)**;
    - **B7 (Biotin)**;
    - **B9 (Folate)**;
    - **B12 (Cobalamine)**;
    - **Lipoic acid**;
    - **Choline**;
    - **Vitamin C**.
- Fat-soluble vitamins:
    - **Vitamin A**;
    - **Vitamin D**;
    - **Vitamin E**;
    - **Vitamin K**.
 
 **Non-essential nutrients** are nutrients that the body can manufacture on its own on demand by 
 complex metabolic processes via chemical messengers, like hormones.

 There are also case when some non-essential nutrients become **conditionally essential nutrients**. This happens during periods of high stress, illness, or when the body can no longer synthesise (produce) them on its own.

 Conditionally essential:
 - **Arginine**;
 - **Cysteine**;
 - **Glutamine**;
 - **Glycine**;
 - **Proline**;
 - **Tyrosine**;
 - **Inositol**;
 - **Coenzyme Q10**;
 - **Carnitine**.

There are also some non-essential nutrients that have become essential because of our highly polluted and stressful environment which negatively impacted our genetic makeup.

 Unfortunately, because the app relies on the USDA Food Database, not all essential nutrients are available in the database. Also, although oxygen is the most important nutrient and essential for life, it does not belong to our diet and it is unrealistic, not to mention impractical, to keep track of our breaths.

 Another commonly known nutrient classification is by the daily amount needed. **Macronutrients**, or macros, are nutrients needed in large amounts, usually in grams, whereas **micronutrients** are nutrients needed in small amounts, usually in milligrams or micrograms.

Macronutrients:
- **Water**;
- **Protein**;
- **Carbohydrates**;
- **Lipids (Fats)**;
- **Alcohol**.

Micronutrients (see list above):
- **Minerals** (Electrolytes and Trace minerals);
- **Vitamins** (Water-soluble and Fat-soluble).

### Macronutrients
Macronutrients are required in large amounts because they are the major source of our **energy** in the form of kilocalories or simply **Calories**. I am sure you are familiar with this term, as it is a lot of fuss around it in the fitness industry. A Calorie (kcal) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram (kg) of water by 1 degree Celsius (Â°C).

Your focus should not be Calories per se, but the source of the Calories. I am not saying Calories are not important, on the contrary, But, in the beginning, the most important goal is to develop life long healthy habits and nutritional awareness.

The only thing you need to remember is this: *100 Calories of spinach are not equal to 100 Calories of soda*.

With the exception of water, which doesn't provide energy at all, protein, carbohydrates, and fat provide energy. More precisely, lipids provide 9 Calories per gram, whereas both carbohydrates and protein provide 4 Calories per gram.

Our energy should come from all these 3 macronutrients, in the right proportion in accordance to our biochemical individuality. They should also be at the highest quality possible.

#### Carbohydrates
**Carbohydrates** or, simply, carbs are the primary energy source for the human body. As their 
name suggests, they are organic compounds made of water and carbon (hydrated carbon). From the nutritional perspective, carbohydrates are **chains of sugar molecules**.

**Glucose**, the simple carbohydrate used as fuel by the body, is required primarily by the nervous system and the brain (the only  organ 
dependent on glucose), and during high intensity physical activities. As a side note, the brain 
can survive on ketones for short periods of time when glucose is not available.

Carbohydrates are divided in two categories: **simple** and **complex**. The more sugar molecules
 a carbohydrate contains, the more complex the carbohydrate. Simple carbohydrates have only one 
 (monosaccharides) or two (disaccharides) sugar molecules, whereas complex carbohydrates have 
 three or multiple (polysaccharides) sugar molecules.

Carbohydrates:
- **Monosaccharides** (Glucose, Fructose, Galactose);
- **Disaccharides** (Sucrose, Maltose, Lactose);
- **Polysaccharides** (Starch, Fiber).

**Fiber** is an indigestible carbohydrate, but has tremendous benefits for our health, especially 
our colon. It is found in the skin of the plants. Fiber is composed of two parts: soluble and insoluble fiber.

**Soluble fiber** dissolves in water and it is fermented in the colon by gut 
bacteria into useful by-products. It acts as **prebiotic** delays gastric emptying (increases feeling of fullness).

**Insoluble fiber** does not dissolve in water and is not fermented by gut bacteria, though there
 are some forms of fermentable insoluble fiber like **resistant starch** that act as prebiotic in a 
 similar manner soluble fiber does. Insoluble fiber is very useful for regular bowel movements. 

Whenever we consume carbohydrates, our body releases a hormone called **insulin** to metabolize the sugar molecules resulted from the breakdown of the carbohydrates. The faster the carbohydrates are digested and absorbed, the higher the insulin spike. Constant high insulin spikes have negative impact on our health (i.e. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity).

With the help of insulin, glucose is stored in the form of **glycogen** in our liver and 
muscles or, when glycogen stores are full, are converted into fat via **lipogenesis** and stored 
into our adipose tissues.

Glucose is released during periods of high intensity physical activity and when our nervous 
system demands it with the help of **glucagon** (the opposite of insulin). It can also be produce
 from non-carbohydrate source via **gluconeogenesis**, with the help of glucagon, 
 **epinephrine**, **norepinephrine**, **cortisol**, and **growth hormone** during periods of 
 fasting and low intensity physical activities.

Paradoxically, because the human body can create it's own glucose, **carbohydrates are not 
essential** per se for our growth and development. Though, this doesn't mean that a very low 
carbohydrate diet, like the Ketogenic diet for instance, is a healthy diet for the long-term, at 
least not for every individual, as it leads to hormonal imbalance in some individuals. 
***Carbohydrates are not evil. Processed and/or excess carbohydrate consumption is evil.***

Carbohydrates are found in **natural sweeteners** (e.g. honey), **grains and grain derived products** (e.g. flour), **legumes**, **fruits**, and **vegetables**. Fresh fruits and vegetables are least abundant in carbohydrates and more abundant in essential nutrients. They are the most nutrient dense foods on the planet and should be the base of our diets. Sweeteners, grains, and legumes should be reduced dramatically.

Of course, the majority of processed (refined) foods are based on simple carbohydrates: bread, 
pasta, candy, sugars, pastries, doughnuts, bagels, potato chips, french fries, you name it. These should be avoided completely. They do not provide any health benefits; they just temporarily please our senses.

**Sugar, wheat, and soy-based products are highly pro-inflammatory** and are responsible for 
appetite cravings, body fat gains, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, high LDL (bad) cholesterol, high triglycerides, low HDL (good) cholesterol, nervous system damage, and cancer. Unfortunately, all packaged foods are based on these ingredients, hence, you should read the labels very well before buying them or, simpler, buy foods without labels.

#### Lipids
**Lipids** or fats are our backup source of energy for when carbohydrates are absent. They have 
the same chemical structure like carbohydrates, but with less water than carbohydrates. This is the main reason why they are more energy dense.

Lipids include:
- **Triglycerides**;
- **Phospholipids**;
- **Sterols**.

Fat is the most proffered energy storage in the body in adipose tissue and the most proffered 
energy source during rest and low intensity physical activities - when insulin is low or absent.

Despite of its bad reputation, because of its association with negative body image, fat has 
important functions in the body:
- **Organ protection**;
- **Temperature regulation**;
- **Nerve cell insulation** (myelin sheath);
- **Cell protection and intercellular communication** (phospholipid cell membranes);
- **Bile salts**;
- **Sex hormones**;
- **Fat-soluble vitamin absorption and storage**;
- **Taste enhancement**;
- **Nutrient transportation** (lipoproteins).

Triglycerides, triacylglycerols, or, commonly, dietary fat are the most common lipids found in food 
(95%). They are what we call fat in our food which is totally different than the fat 
(lipids) in the body. Eating fat does not not make us fat the same way eating spinach does not makes us green.

Triglycerides (fats) are composed of three **fatty acids** and one **glycerol** molecule. The same 
way 
carbohydrates are chains of sugar molecules, triglycerides are chains of fatty acids.

Judging by their fatty acid chains, triglycerides can be classified according to their:
- chain length (number of carbons in each fatty acid);
    - **Short-chain fatty acids** or triglycerides (SCT) - <6 carbon atoms;
    - **Medium-chain fatty acids** or triglycerides (MCT) - 6-12 carbon atoms;
    - **Long-chain fatty acids** or triglycerides (LCT) - >12 carbon atoms.
    
- level of saturation (how much hydrogen is attached to each carbon atom in the fatty acid chain);
    - **Saturated fatty acids** (SFA) - all carbons atoms saturated with hydrogen (no double bonds);
    - **Monounsaturated fatty acids** (MUFA) - one carbon atom is unsaturated with hydrogen (1 double bond);
    - **Polyunsaturated fatty acids** (PUFA) - more than one carbon atoms are unsaturated with 
    hydrogen (>1 double bonds).
    
- shape:
    - **Cis-unsaturated fatty acids**;
    - **Trans-unsaturated fatty acids** - obtained during hydrogenation.

All four essential fatty acids mentioned previously in this lesson are PUFAs and belong to the 
**Omega-3** (ALA, EPA, DHA) and **Omega-6** (LA) fatty acid groups. Omega-3 fatty acids are known
 to be anti-inflammatory, whereas omega-6 fatty acids are pro-inflammatory, so the higher the 
 omega-3/omega-6s ratio, the better.

EPA and DHA are most abundant in wild-caught cold water (fatty) fish (i.e. mackerel, sardines, salmon, herring).

Fat is the only macronutrient that does **not stimulate insulin** secretion in order to be 
absorbed. With the help of the **bile**, a substance produced by the liver from cholesterol, 
phospholipids (e.g. Lechithin), and electrolytes, and other pancreatic enzymes, fats are 
emulsified and broken down into free fatty acids and monoglycerides.

The bile is stored in the gallbladder until the secretion of **cholecystokinin** (CCK) tells it 
to be released. With the exception of SCTs and MCTs, which are directly absorbed and used as 
energy (not stored), the broken down (hydrophobic) fats are packaged into hydrophilic (water "lover") 
lipoproteins called **chylomicrons** and delivered through the lymphatic system to the cells.

There are three primary fates of the packaged dietary triglycerides:
- immediately used as a source of energy for the cells, especially by the muscle cells;
- used to make lipid-containing compounds in the body;
- stored in the muscle or adipose tissue for later use.

Chylomicrons unload the dietary triglycerides into the cells with the help of **lipoprotein lipase** (LPL).

The commonly measured blood cholesterol is not actually cholesterol, but the lipoproteins. As 
their name suggests, lipoproteins are made or lipids and proteins and are categorized by their 
protein density (lipid/protein ratio):
- **Chylomicrons** (>80% triglycerides) - produced in the enterocytes only after a dietary fat is
 consumed and serve as **exogenous triglycerides transporters to the cells**;
- **Very-Low-Density Lipoproteins** (VLDL) (>50% triglycerides) - produced by the liver when extra fat, sugar, or/and calories are consumed and serve as **endogenous triglycerides transporters to 
the cells**;
- **Low-Density Lipoproteins** (LDL) (<50% lipids) - resulted when VLDLs release their containing triglycerides and serve as **cholesterol transporters to the cells**;
- **High-Density Lipoproteins** (HDL) (<20% lipids) - are produced by the liver with the purpose of **cleaning the blood vessels of cholesterol** and delivering it back to the liver for recycling.

The biggest issue is with constant high serum LDL levels. Blood circulating LDLs that haven't 
been reused by the liver oxidize and degrade over time. This adhesion causes âscavengerâ white blood cells to rush to the site and bind 
cholesterol to their receptors. As more and more cholesterol binds to these cells, they burst to 
form a fatty patch, or plaque, that eventually becomes fibrous and calcified, blocking the artery
 (like residues in a pipe).
 
The most important number in the blood lipids biomarker when it comes to (cardiovascular) health is
 the **HDL ratio relative to LDL and triglycerides (the higher, the better)** and not the total 
 serum cholesterol itself. Quality is more
 important than quantity.
 
Dietary saturated fat and cholesterol do, indeed, increase total blood cholesterol, but it 
increases both HDL and LDL harmonically. Thus, no harm done. On the other hand plant seed oils 
and margarine, due to their hydrogenation and - unstable - polyunsaturated fat content, decrease 
total blood cholesterol by decreasing HDL levels. They also cause inflammation, cellular 
and DNA damage, cancer, and many other health issues.

Plant seed oils and margarine should be completely eliminated and substituted with unprocessed good 
quality butter, lard, tallow, coconut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil. Also, high sugar 
consumption, including high fructose containing fruits, causes high levels of blood 
triglycerides and low levels of HDL and should be minimised as much as possible.

There are other environmental factors that contribute to impaired blood lipid quality:
- alcohol;
- smoking;
- chronic stress;
- inactivity;
- genetics;
- illness.

Fat abundant foods:
- Saturated fat and Cholesterol:
    - **Organ meats**;
    - **Coconuts**;
    - **Dairy**.
    
- Monounsaturated fat:
    - **Olives**;
    - **Avocados**.
    
- Polyunsaturated fat and Phytosterols:
    - **Nuts**;
    - **Seeds**;
    - **Wild cold water fish** (Omega-3s).
    
#### Protein
**Protein** is third most important nutrient, after oxygen and water, as it is part of every single 
tissue in our body (i.e. muscles, bones, blood, hormones, enzymes, antibodies, etc.). They have 
numeric important functions, including:
- **Cell growth, repair, and maintenance**;
- **Enzymes and hormones**;
- **Fluid and electrolyte balance**;
- **AcidâBase balance**;
- **Strong immune system maintenance**;
- **Energy source**;
- **Nutrient storage and transportation**.

Unlike the other macronutrients, proteins contain nitrogen and sulfur, and their structure is 
dictated by DNA. Protein structure, which is the result of **gene expression**, dictates its function.

Proteins are chains of **amino acids** (>50) linked together via **peptide** bonds, hence, proteins 
may be more generically called **polypeptides**. There are **20 amino acids** of which only 9 are 
essential (see list above) and must be provided through diet. There are also cases (i.e. chronic 
stress, illness), when some non-essential amino acids become essential. The latter are called 
conditionally essential amino acids, because they are essential only in specific conditions.

Dietary proteins are classified according to their essential amino acid content:
- **complete (high-quality)** - contain all essential amino acids;
- **incomplete (low-quality)** - contain some or none essential amino acids.

It is important to provide all essential amino acids through diet in order for protein synthesis 
to occur. Just one missing amino acid or the insufficient quantity of it and the protein 
synthesis is stalled. For instance, a deficiency of histidine prevents the body from producing 
hemoglobin, the main protein component (96%) of red blood cells and the responsible for oxygen and 
carbon dioxide transportation.

It is also important to ensure proper energy intake from dietary fats and carbohydrates to 
prevent the use of essential amino acids as energy.

Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids in the stomach with the help oh **hydrochloric 
acid** and **pepsin**. The higher the stomach acidity, the better the digestion and absorption.

The highest quality protein sources, from both essential amino acid content and protein 
digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS > 90%), are animal products: **eggs**, **fish**, 
and **red meat**.

Plant protein sources are the lowest protein quality from both amino acid content and 
digestibility. Though, it is also possible to provide all essential amino acids by combining 
different plants (incomplete protein sources) in the diet (**mutual supplementation**).

Of all the macronutrients, protein offers the **highest satiety**.

Although protein is crucial, too much protein can do more harm than good. High protein intake 
or/and from low quality sources (e.g. commercial and/or processed animal products) may 
increase the risk of heart disease, bone loss, kidney disease, and even tumours (cancer).
